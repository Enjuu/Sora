# Enjuu's new custom Bancho!
We decided to replace a lot of legacy code and are switching to a completely new backend solution called 'Sora'. Sora is a modular bancho written in C# by [Mempler](https://github.com/Mempler/). It's a modern and flexible approach to osu! private servers featuring:

- Plugin API
- Native Pisstaube ([chimu.moe](https://chimu.moe)) integration
- Bukkit-like permission system
- Full docker support

# Writing plugins

Sora's plugin API makes it easy for anyone to add new features like bot commands or even frontends. [Here](https://github.com/Enjuu/Sora/tree/master/Examples/ExamplePlugin) you'll find a sample plugin to start coding!
